Hey folks!

So I have a *proof of concept* build for Reactive Retro ready. What is Reactive Retro, you say? Well, it's a location-based game that aims to be like an older JRPG, with a focus on cooperative play. Right now, there isn't a whole lot though.

If you're interested in trying it out, first [join this community](https://plus.google.com/communities/111450430548057393491). That will let you [sign up on this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.reactive.retro/join) to be an alpha tester. Shortly after, you should be able to get the app from the [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reactive.retro).

If you have feedback, please send it to the google+ community!

Here's what you can do, currently:

* sign up using gmail, facebook, or your email
* change character class, skills, and equipment
* explore the area around you, and engage in combat with monsters

These things are not at all implemented:

* gaining experience and leveling up
* only being able to target monsters in your area range (this means you can target anything on the map)
* monsters dying - you can keep fighting the same one over and over

There will be more, but I want to make sure the first build is solid.
