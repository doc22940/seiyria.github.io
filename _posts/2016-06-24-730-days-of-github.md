Today marks 2 years of my doing "one thing a day" on Github.

_I've got work to do today, but I wanted to blog first, so today appears empty_

I [posted about last year](http://seiyria.com/javascript,/github,/life/2015/06/05/365-days-of-github.html), and now I'm posting about this year! I'm not going to do monthly graphs or anything this time around, but I'll talk about a bunch of projects that I worked on. I'll split it between my own projects, and other projects. Here are my projects (or projects I'm affiliated with):




* [bootstrap-slider](http://seiyria.com/bootstrap-slider) (a small slider widget for websites, recently refactored to not require jQuery)
* angular-bootstrap-slider (a wrapper for bootstrap-slider)
* squelch-irc/squelch (an IRC client)
* [Roguathia](http://seiyria.com/Roguathia) (an idle roguelike)
* steam-avg-pct-cli (a CLI tool to get your "average game completion percent" from Steam)
* [steam-avg-pct](http://seiyria.com/steam-avg-pct/) (a web tool, similar to the CLI tool, but features sortable lists)
* [tournamentmango](http://tournamentmango.com) (a web-based tournament management system)
* [dos-strap](http://seiyria.com/dos-strap/) (a bootstrap 3 theme that looks "retro" - used in Roguathia)
* Rabrennie/ParkyParkPark (an open source clone of No Brakes Valet)
* [gw2skins](http://seiyria.com/gw2skins/) (a tool to show you what skins you haven't unlocked in gw2)
* reactive-retro (a gps-based RPG, recently revived and now dead again)
* castle-carnage-cards (I open-sourced the scripts used to build Castle Carnage [before deck.zone])
* my-house-cli (a small tool built on Tessel which creates realtime charts for temperature and other metrics in my apartment)
* [my-house](http://seiyria.com/my-house/) (a GUI for the above)
* [deck.zone](http://deck.zone) (a tool to help people make board games. Unfortunately doesn't work _entirely_ correctly - see [my medium post](https://medium.com/@seiyria/the-sad-state-of-printing-on-the-web-7ac68c50cc4d#.frd9x2e18))
* [gameicons-font](http://seiyria.com/gameicons-font/) (a tool that wraps the icons at http://game-icons.net into a web font)
* ng2-ace (an ng2 directive for the [Ace editor](https://ace.c9.io/build/kitchen-sink.html))
* ng2-sweetalert2 (a small wrapper designed for ng2 of [sweetalert2](https://limonte.github.io/sweetalert2/))
* ng2-storage (a port of [gsklee/ngStorage](https://github.com/gsklee/ngStorage) to ng2. ES6 Proxy rocks!)
* ng2-fontawesome (a small wrapper for [font awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) because I am lazy and want to make using it as easy as possible)

Here are projects started by others:

* npm/npm-expansions (I contributed "no points made"!)
* MarcelloLins/GooglePlayAppsCrawler (I contributed a few features, fixes, and got it set up on travis-ci)
* leftstick/gulp-nw-builder (I made it show the error when the plugin fails, since it was failing in a weird case I was hitting)
* marceljuenemann/angular-drag-and-drop-lists (I just contributed a typo fix)
* fosjump/fosjump (I contributed lots of documentation fixes)
* tessel/ambient-attx4 (I contributed a fix for the hardware erroneously emitting an error event)
* Hardmath123/nearley (I contributed some new data types, and consistent-ified others)
* limonte/sweetalert2 (I contributed documentation)

There was also a pretty big life change: I started working as a contractor from home around August of last year. I've been able to contribute to open source more often than before as a result. Also, instead of keeping small improvements to myself (or moving on, in case of doc fixes), I started suggesting them upstream. There was a time or two where it wasn't well-received (or in the case of one of my outstanding PRs, not received at all!), but overall, people seem to appreciate those small kinds of fixes :D.

Another thing that happened was I got a [Tessel](http://tessel.io)! I waited through something like 8 months of delays to finally get it, and I made a small temperature monitor for my apartment. Then I found out it had a few issues. Nothing I couldn't work around, but overall it was really fun to work with. I may be picking up another one to make an automatic dog feeder, too!

I also started making a board game (called Castle Carnage)! After doing that for a while, I wanted to make it easier and better for everyone, so I started working on deck.zone. As a result, I published a handful of ng2 components that I made for deck.zone.

Lots of fun stuff. Looking forward to another year of open source, but I might let gaps in my timeline next time. Then again, habits are pretty hard to break.
