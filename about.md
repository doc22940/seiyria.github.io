I'm 23, like to write code, and I have a [lot of projects](https://github.com/seiyria). I've made web applications, [an idle rpg](https://github.com/IdleLands), [a documentation tool](https://github.com/kellyirc/doks), [a small incremental game](https://github.com/seiyria/c), and [an irc bot](https://github.com/kellyirc/kurea).

I'm also a part time contributor to [herosheets](http://www.herosheets.com/).

Currently, my main project is a small GPS game called [Reactive Retro](https://github.com/reactive-retro). I'm learning to use [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com), [SocketCluster](http://socketcluster.io) and a small other assortment of tools.
