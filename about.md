I'm 23, like to write code, and I have a [lot of projects](https://github.com/seiyria). I've made web applications, [an idle rpg](https://github.com/IdleLands), [a documentation tool](https://github.com/kellyirc/doks), [a small incremental game](https://github.com/seiyria/c), [a small (incomplete) platformer](http://seiyria.com/defiled-dreams/), [an irc bot](https://github.com/kellyirc/kurea), a [small utility to help finish a guild wars 2 wardrobe](https://github.com/seiyria/gw2skins), a [utility to calculate steam average completion percentage](http://seiyria.com/steam-avg-pct/), a [small, idle roguelike](https://github.com/seiyria/Roguathia), a [tournament bracket/player management system](http://seiyria.com/tournamentmango), and a [retro Bootstrap 3 theme](http://seiyria.com/dos-strap/). I also help maintain a [mildly successful open source project](https://github.com/seiyria/bootstrap-slider).

I'm also a part time contributor to [herosheets](http://www.herosheets.com/).

My current projects include:

* A small GPS game called [Reactive Retro](https://github.com/reactive-retro). I'm learning to use [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com), [SocketCluster](http://socketcluster.io) and a small other assortment of tools.
* [A tournament bracket and user management system](https://github.com/seiyria/tournamentmango).
